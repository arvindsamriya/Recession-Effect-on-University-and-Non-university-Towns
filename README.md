# Project
Comparing price ratio (quarter before recession/recession bottom) of university and non-university towns and find out the relationship between them by performing t-test on price-ratio and with the use of pandas, numpy, ttest_ind , the complete description is inside the ipynb or .py file.
## What to learn
I have Frequently used the Data Manipulation,Data Cleaning and Data merging in this, learned the use of pandas and numpy, with little bit of scipy library for t-testing.
# where to Improve
Although this whole project is completed, but at some points I have used hardcoding for cleaning the data, there you can make change to generalize and improve.
